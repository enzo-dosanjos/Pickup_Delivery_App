### Frontend (React App)

The project includes a React frontend application located in the `/react-app` directory.

#### How to Run the React App

To see the React display, you need to have Node.js and npm installed.

1.  **Navigate to the React application directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-app
    ```
2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start a local development server and display a link you can click on to open the React application in your web browser.

**Important: Node.js Version:**
This project's React dependencies require Node.js version 20 or higher.

#### React App Dependencies

The React app relies on the following main dependencies:
-   `react` & `react-dom`
-   `react-router` for routing
-   `leaflet` & `react-leaflet` for interactive maps
-   `vite` as the build tool

All dependencies are listed in `react-app/package.json` and are installed automatically with `npm install`.
